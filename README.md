# Honour's Project - Ayon

Currently, this repo contains the code for decoding a baseline encoded, YCrCb image using Python. The code is modified from Raul Aguaviva's MIT licensed [micro-jpeg-visualizer](https://github.com/aguaviva/micro-jpeg-visualizer) repo and Yasoob Khalid's code [Baseline-JPEG-Decoder](https://github.com/yasoob/Baseline-JPEG-Decoder) code. This is highly unoptimized code.
